;;; Commentary:

;; Customizable print facility.
;;
;; The heart of it is the generic function `cl-print-object' to which you
;; can add any method you like.
;;
;; The main entry point is `cl-prin1'.

;;; Code:

(defvar cl-print-readably nil
  "If non-nil, try and make sure the result can be `read'.")

(defvar cl-print--number-table nil)
